## Hi there 👋,

I'm James, a **full-stack web developer** with a focus on **Ruby**, **Rails**, **JS**, and **React**.

I trained at **Makers Academy** and have been coding full-time since 2022. This is my second career after 20 years in business and product management across the insurance and healthcare industries.

Seeking greater technical and intellectual challenge, and drawing on lifelong interests in computing, design, and maths, I completed Makers Academy’s immersive full-stack software engineering bootcamp in 2014. Although my professional roles were in management, I've kept coding throughout — and in 2022, I made a full-time move into professional software engineering.
