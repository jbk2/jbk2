### Hi there 👋, I'm James,

A full-stack web developer, focusing on **Ruby**, **Rails**, **JS**, and **React**.

I trained at Makers Academy and have been coding full-time since 2022. This is my second career after 20 years in business and product management within the insurance and healthcare industries.

Itching for more technical and intellectual challenges in my work, and with lifelong interests in computing, design, and maths, I retrained as a software engineer graduating Makers Academy’s on campus immersive full-stack software engineering bootcamp in 2014. Although my professional work remained in management, I kept coding throughout, and in 2022 I made the full-time move into professional software engineering.
