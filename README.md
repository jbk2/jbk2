Seeking more technical and intellectual challenge in my work, and with lifelong interest in computing, design, and maths, I retrained as a full stack web developer graduating Makers Academy’s on campus immersive full-stack software engineering bootcamp in 2014. Although my professional work remained in management, I kept coding throughout, and in 2023 I made the switch to full-time professional software engineering.
