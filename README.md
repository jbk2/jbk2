### Hi there 👋, I'm James,

A full-stack web developer, focusing on **Ruby**, **Rails**, **JS**, and **React**.

I trained at **Makers Academy** and have been coding full-time since 2022. This is my second career after 20 years in business and product management roles within the insurance and healthcare industries.

Wanting more technical and intellectual challenge in my work, and with lifelong interests in computing, design, and maths, I retrained as a software engineer graduating Makers Academy’s immersive full-stack software engineering bootcamp in 2014. Although my professional roles were in management, I've kept coding throughout — and in 2022, I made a full-time move into professional software engineering.

### 🧠 I’m currently Working On
- An **MCP server** for insurance industry.
- Learning **TypeScript** and **GraphQL**.
- Exploring **open-source** project contribution.

### 👀 I’m currently Looking For
- a **junior web developer** role - to apply my skills, grow within a collaborative engineering team, and work on building real-world software products.
- **freelance web developer** work - putting skills to work & building portfolio.
