### Hi I'm James 👋,

A full-stack web developer, focussing on **Ruby**, **Rails**, **JS**, and **React**</sup>.

I trained in software engineering at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/software-engineering-bootcamp) and have been coding full-time since 2023. This is my second career after a successful 20 years in business and product management.

Seeking more technical and intellectual challenge in my work, and with lifelong interest in computing, engineering and design, I retrained as a full stack web developer. I graduated Makers Academy’s on campus full-stack software engineering bootcamp in 2014. Although my professional work remained in management, I kept coding throughout, and in 2023 I made the switch to full-time professional software development.

### 🧠 I'm currently Working On

- An **MCP server** for the insurance industry.
- Learning **TypeScript** and **GraphQL**.

### 👀 I'm currently Looking For

- A **web developer** role — apply my skills, grow within a collaborative team, and build real-world products.
- High quality **freelance web developer** work — put skills to use and keep building my portfolio.
