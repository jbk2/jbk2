### Hi I'm James 👋,

Full-stack web developer - **Ruby**, **Rails**, **JS**, **React**.

Itching for more technical and intellectual challenges in my work, and with lifelong interests in computing, design and maths, I retrained as a software engineer following a 20 year career in business and product management within the insurance and healthcare industries. I graduated Makers Academy’s on campus immersive full-stack software engineering bootcamp in 2014. Although my professional work remained in management, I kept coding throughout, and in 2023 I made the full-time move into professional software engineering.
