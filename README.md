### Hi I'm James 👋,

A full-stack web developer, focussing on **Ruby**, **Rails**, **JS**, and **React**</sup>.

I trained in software engineering at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/software-engineering-bootcamp) and have been coding full-time since 2023. This is my second career after 20 years in product and business management.

From writing games in BASIC in the 80’s to websites in Dreamweaver in the 90’s I’ve had a lifelong interest in computing, engineering and design. Seeking greater technical and intellectual challenge in my work I retrained as a full-stack developer, graduating from Makers Academy’s bootcamp in 2014. I continued to code alongside my business and product management roles until switching to full-time software development at the start of 2023.

### 🧠 I'm currently Working On

- An **MCP server** for the insurance industry.
- Learning **TypeScript** and **GraphQL**.

### 👀 I'm currently Looking For

- A **web developer** role — apply my skills, grow within a collaborative team, and build real-world products.
- High quality **freelance web developer** work — put skills to use and keep building my portfolio.
